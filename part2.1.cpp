bool isPalindrome(string S)
{
    int n=S.size();
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(S[i]!=S[n-i-1]) return false;
     }
   return true;
}


Input Parameter: The function takes a string S as its input parameter.

Palindrome Check: It iterates through the characters of the string using a loop. For each character at position i, it compares it with the character at the symmetric position n - i - 1, where n is the length of the string.

Return Value: If at any point, the characters are not equal (indicating a mismatch between the corresponding characters from the start and end of the string), the function immediately returns false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the function returns true, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

Note: This function assumes that the input string S is non-empty.

In essence, the function is a simple and commonly used approach to check if a given string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If the characters match at all corresponding positions, the string is considered a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
