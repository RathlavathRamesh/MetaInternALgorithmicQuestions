What is SQL?
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that allows both technical and non-technically-minded users to query, manipulate, and change data in a relational database.

Organized into columns and rows within a table, SQL databases use a relational model that work best with well-defined structured data, such as names and quantities, in which relations exist between different entities. Within a SQL database, tables are linked through "foreign keys" that form relations between different tables and fields, such as customers and orders or employees and departments.

SQL databases are scalable vertically, meaning that you can increase the maximum load by adding further storage components like RAM or SSD. While in some cases this may mean that SQL databases are limited by the resources available on the server, cloud-based storage and other technologies can provide more scalability with SQL. 


What is NoSQL?
NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a manner other than the tabular relations used within SQL databases. While SQL databases are best used for structured data, NoSQL databases are suitable for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. As a result, NoSQL databases don't follow a rigid schema but instead have more flexible structures to accommodate their data-types. Furthermore, instead of using SQL to query the database, NoSQL databases use varying query languages (some don't even have a query language).

NoSQL databases are scalable horizontally, meaning that they use multiple nodes in a cluster to handle increased workloads. This allows data architects to simply scale them by supplementing clusters with additional servers.

NoSQL non-relational databases work well with unstructured data and typically possess the following properties:

NoSQL is schema-less (no fixed data model).

NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema for unstructured data, making integrating data in certain types of applications easier and faster.

NoSQL uses non-tabular data models, which can be document-oriented, key-value, or graph-based. The most common NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, Redis, Neo4j, and CouchDB.

NoSQL manages the scale and agility challenges you may face in modern applications, especially ones that handle large volumes of rapidly changing data. These demands exist across every industry vertical and application domain, including IoT, user analytics, personalization, ad tech, eCommerce, gaming, and social networks.

Main differences between NoSQL and SQL
At a high level, NoSQL and SQL databases have many similarities.

In addition to supporting data storage and queries, they both also allow one to retrieve, update, and delete stored data. However, under the surface lie some significant differences that affect NoSQL versus SQL performance, scalability, and flexibility.

Here are some of the main differences between SQL versus NoSQL databases:

Structure
SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases can be document-oriented, key-value pairs, or graph structures. In a NoSQL database, a document can contain key value pairs, which can then be ordered and nested.

Scalability
SQL databases scale vertically, usually on a single server, and require users to increase physical hardware to increase their storage capacities. In effect, while cloud-storage options are available, SQL databases can be prohibitively expensive for businesses when dealing with vast amounts of big data.

NoSQL databases offer horizontal scalability, meaning that more servers simply need to be added to increase their data load. This means that NoSQL databases are better for modern cloud-based infrastructures, which offer distributed resources.

Language
SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language). NoSQL databases use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML, YAML, or binary schema, facilitating unstructured data. SQL has a fixed-defined schema, while NoSQL databases are more flexible.

Support
SQL is a popular standard language that is well supported by many different database systems, while NoSQL has varying levels of support in various database systems.

Regarding support, you’ll generally find that more help is available for SQL databases than NoSQL. This is because SQL is a more established technology and thus has many more users and developers who can help you with your problems. In contrast, NoSQL is still relatively new, with less help available on forums or through the community. Your support options may be limited if you run into difficulties using it.




Pros and cons of SQL
SQL is the lingua franca of data. It's the language you’ll use most to query databases and move structured data between traditional applications. It's a powerful language that can help you do many data-related things but also has some downsides.

Here are some pros and cons of using SQL for data storage and retrieval.

Pros of SQL:


SQL is widely understood and supported; most developers know it well.

SQL is extremely useful for simple aggregations over large datasets, such as calculating averages.

SQL is extremely useful for setting up simple ETL jobs, especially if the input and output formats are relational databases.

SQL is well-documented and easy to learn.

Cons of SQL:


The performance of SQL can be poor on substantial data sets because it requires multiple passes over the data to complete many operations (especially joins). 

Debugging SQL can be complicated because it doesn't provide informative error messages.

The syntax of SQL tends to be verbose compared with programming languages like Python or R, which makes it harder to write complex transformations as scripts or functions.

Pros and cons of NoSQL
A significant benefit of NoSQL is that you don't have to define a schema upfront (or ever). This makes it easy to add new columns without dealing with all the issues involved in altering a vast table with lots of data already in it. It also means that if your queries don't require SQL, you can avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling SQL statements, modeling, and storing, providing an enormous performance boost when dealing with large amounts of data.

However, NoSQL is less mature than SQL. Here’s a look at NoSQL's pros and cons.

Pros of NoSQL:


Flexible schema

Usable on distributed infrastructure platforms

Low-cost infrastructure

High availability and throughput

Cons of NoSQL:


Less mature technology and difficult to manage

Limited query capabilities

Data inconsistency and poor performance in some complex scenarios

When to use: SQL vs. NoSQL 
Deciding when to use NoSQL versus SQL is essential because they differ in structure, capabilities, and ideal use cases.

A relational database like SQL is a great option if you’re looking to build an application structured around a relationship between data tables. SQL also works well when you want to ensure your data is consistent across tables. However, relational databases aren’t always the best choice regarding flexibility or scaling.

A non-relational NoSQL database doesn’t use structured tables but instead uses flexible schemas for unstructured data storage. This gives you more ability to scale your project as needed. However, it also means you have less control over consistency and data relationships.














SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two broad categories of database management systems, and they differ in terms of data storage models, structure, and use cases.

SQL Databases:
Data Model:

SQL databases are relational databases that organize data in tables with rows and columns.
They use a structured schema, meaning the data must follow a predefined structure.
Examples:

MySQL:

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system.
Suitable for a wide range of applications, including content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and data-driven websites.
PostgreSQL:

PostgreSQL is another powerful open-source relational database system.
Suitable for applications that require advanced features, such as geographic information systems (GIS) and complex data analysis.
Use Cases:

Applications with well-defined schemas and relationships between different types of data.
Situations where data integrity is crucial.
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are required, ensuring transactions are processed reliably.
NoSQL Databases:
Data Model:

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that can store data in various formats, including key-value pairs, document-oriented, graph databases, and wide-column stores.
They are schema-less, allowing for flexibility in the types and structures of data stored.
Examples:

MongoDB:

A popular document-oriented NoSQL database.
Suitable for applications with dynamic schemas and complex data structures, such as content management systems and real-time big data applications.
Cassandra:

A wide-column store NoSQL database designed for scalability and high availability.
Suitable for time-series data, sensor data, and other scenarios requiring distributed and horizontally scalable databases.
Use Cases:

Applications with evolving or undefined schemas.
Rapid development and iteration of applications where data requirements may change frequently.
Horizontal scalability and distribution of data across multiple servers or clusters.
Handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Summary:
SQL databases are suitable for applications with structured and well-defined data where ACID properties are critical. Examples include traditional business applications, financial systems, and systems where data relationships are essential.

NoSQL databases are suitable for applications with flexible and evolving data structures, requiring horizontal scalability and the ability to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include content management systems, real-time analytics, and applications with varying data formats.
