Code Documentation:

Document your code to make it readable and understandable for others (and future you).
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Include comments where necessary to explain complex parts of the code.
Code Modularity:

Divide your code into small, reusable modules or functions.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle - each module or function should have a single responsibility.
Version Control:

Use version control systems like Git to track changes to your code.
Commit regularly and write clear commit messages.
